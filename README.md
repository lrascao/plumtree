Plumtree
=======================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lrascao/plumtree.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/lrascao/plumtree)

Plumtree is an implementation of [Plumtree](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~ler/reports/srds07.pdf), the epidemic broadcast protocol.  It is based in [Lasp's]() implementation which in turn is based off [Riak Core](https://github.com/basho/riak_core). It uses [Partisan](https://github.com/lasp-lang/partisan) a peer sampling service which notably offers [Hyparview](http://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/dsn07-leitao.pdf), the Hybrid Partial view protocol.

More information on the plumtree protocol and it's history we encourage you to watch Jordan West's [RICON West 2013 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4cCUTPU8GI) and Joao Leitao & Jordan West's [RICON 2014 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo367a6ZAwM).

Credits due to the Basho team on the original implementation, Helium's extraction from Riak to a separate project and Lasp's integration with Partisan.
